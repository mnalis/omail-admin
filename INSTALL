oMail - INSTALL
===============


* You will need:
  --------------

- qmail 1.03 (Dan Bernstein) 
  http://www.qmail.org

- vmailmgrd 0.96.8 or higher (Bruce Guenter)    (didn't tried with any other versions)
  http://www.em.ca/~bruceg/vmailmgr/
  
- uscpi-unix 0.33 or higher (Bruce Guenter)  (needed to make the daemon works)
  http://em.ca/~bruceg/ucspi-unix/

- qmail-autoresponder 0.93 or higher (Bruce Guenter)   
  http://www.em.ca/~bruceg/qmail-autoresponder/

- php 4.0.x
  http://www.php.net

- apache 1.3.x
  http://www.apache.org/httpd.html



* Installation  (draft : if you feel there is anything missing, please contact me!)
  ------------

  1. install qmail, autorespond and vmailmgr

  2. make sure vmailmgrd (the vmailmgr daemon) is running. Don't forget it needs uscpi-unix to work.
     ( for example:  /usr/local/bin/unixserver -v -- /tmp/.vmailmgrd /usr/local/sbin/vmailmgrd -V  )

  3. check config.php  (optional)

  4. make sure you have installed the autoresponder correctely (look at the
     vautoresponder file in the qmail-autoresponder distribution...)

  5. make sure you have "magic_quotes_gpc = Off" in your php.ini  (usually in /usr/local/lib/)
     (just important if there are "'` in the autoresponder message)

  6. if necessary, setup quotas (look next section in INSTALL file)

  7. Well, then it should work out of the box.


  If you make it work on your server, I would be glad to hear from you! 
  Just send a little mail to: omail@omnis.ch. And please, if you translate
  it to another language, please do send me the updated strings.php file!



* Quotas
  ------
  check the vmailmgrquota file, and copy it in /var/qmail/control or /etc/vmailmgr
  more doc to come later about that.

  You can use the quota's configuation file to disallow the use of autoresponders :
  just activate the "default" configuration, and set "0" in the last field...
