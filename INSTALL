oMail - INSTALL
===============

* Note 
  ----
  This is currently totally ALPHA-work. It works very nicely on my test server, but
  it probably won't on your. I'll work on the INSTALL & README file later.
  Comments are welcome! Don't start to translate the program into other languages
  yet : I have to clean up strings.php first.



* You will need:
  --------------
- qmail 1.03 (Dan Bernstein) 
  http://www.qmail.org

- vmailmgrd 0.96.7 (Bruce Guenter)    (didn't tried with any other versions)
  http://www.em.ca/~bruceg/vmailmgr/

- qmail-autoresponder (Bruce Guenter)   
  http://www.em.ca/~bruceg/qmail-autoresponder/

- php 4.0.x
  http://www.php.net

- apache 1.3.x
  http://www.apache.org/httpd.html



* Installation  (draft)
  ------------

  0. install qmail, autorespond and vmailmgr

  1. check config.php

  n. Well, then it should (could :) work...


  If you make it work on your server, I would be glad to hear from you! 
  Just send a little mail to: omail@omnis.ch.
