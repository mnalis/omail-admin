  http://www.em.ca/~bruceg/vmailmgr/
  
- uscpi-unix 0.34 or higher (Bruce Guenter) (needed to make the daemon works)
  http://em.ca/~bruceg/ucspi-unix/

  OR/AND (at least one!)

* Installation  (draft : if you feel there is anything missing, please contact me!)
  ------------

  1. install qmail, autorespond and vmailmgr

  2. make sure that vmailmgrd (the vmailmgr daemon) is running.
     Don't forget it needs uscpi-unix or uscpi-tcp to work.  Check
     INSTALL.daemon for some real-life examples of working setups.

  3. check config.php and setup the configuration variables.

  4. make sure "register_globals" is set ton On in your php.ini configuration
     file, or add a "php_flag register_globals on" to the virtual host 
     setup

  5. if "index.php" is not defined as DirectoryIndex in your Apache
     conf, replace the $script_url = "$SCRIPT_URL"; line in
     config.php by $script_url = "$SCRIPT_URL/index.php"; 

  6. make sure you have installed the autoresponder correctely (look
     at the vautoresponder file in the qmail-autoresponder
     distribution...)

  7. same thing for vmailmgr-user-based quotas (cf. vmailmgr docs)

  8. if necessary, setup domain-based quotas (look next section in
     INSTALL file)

  9. if you want to display mailbox usage (size of accounts), etc.
     you can setup the scripts/vmailstats.pl script. Check the
     readme file in the scripts/ directory.

 10. Well, then it should work correctely. If it's the case, you can
     jump to step 99.

  ...

  99. Have a look at http://cdnow.com/gift/om@omnis.ch  :)

 100. Thanks for using omail-admin!



* Quotas
  ------
  check the vmailmgrquota file, and copy it in /var/qmail/control or
  /etc/vmailmgr more doc to come later about that.

  You can use the quota's configuation file to disallow the use of
  autoresponders : just activate the "default" configuration, and
  set "0" in the last field...



* FAQ
  ---

 [1] Error Message: Protocol version is 0, not the 2 as this script expects.

     This seems to be a common deamon problem, and appears only with
     rpm installations. Here the answer from Ambar Roy:

	this seems to be the same 255,"" problem that everyone is
	getting when they use rpms to install the vmailmgr
	daemon.... and the solution is quite simple... in the
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/vmailmgrd file change the line that reads:
	svc start vmailmgrd to something like:
	nohup /var/service/vmailmgrd/run &
	and things run fine.... now the only problem is that the
	stop function stops working!!!


  [2] Note for Freebsd, from Rick Updegrove <dislists [a-t] updegrove . net>

	FreeBSD 4.9 run script that works
	NEEDS nohup or I get a variety of the error noted in the INSTALL FAQ

		umask 0
		if [ -s /usr/local/etc/vmailmgr/socket-file ]; then
		   socket_file="`head -1 /usr/local/etc/vmailmgr/socket-file`"
		else
		   socket_file=/tmp/.vmailmgrd
		fi

		exec unixserver -v -- $socket_file nohup vmailmgrd -D -V 2>&1
