oMail - INSTALL
===============


* You will need:
  --------------

- qmail 1.03 (Dan Bernstein) 
  http://www.qmail.org

- vmailmgrd 0.96.8 or higher (Bruce Guenter)    (didn't tried with any other versions)
  http://www.em.ca/~bruceg/vmailmgr/
  
- uscpi-unix 0.33 or higher (Bruce Guenter)  (needed to make the daemon works)
  http://em.ca/~bruceg/ucspi-unix/

- qmail-autoresponder 0.93 or higher (Bruce Guenter)   
  http://www.em.ca/~bruceg/qmail-autoresponder/

- php 4.0.x
  http://www.php.net

- apache 1.3.x
  http://www.apache.org/httpd.html



* Installation  (draft)
  ------------

  1. install qmail, autorespond and vmailmgr

  2. make sure vmailmgrd (the vmailmgr daemon) is running. Don't forget it needs uscpi-unix to work.
     (  /usr/local/bin/unixserver -v -- /tmp/.vmailmgrd /usr/local/sbin/vmailmgrd -V  )

  3. check config.php  (optional)

  4. make sure you have installed the autoresponder correctely (look at the
     vautoresponder file in the qmail-autoresponder distribution...)

  5. Well, then it should work out of the box.



  If you make it work on your server, I would be glad to hear from you! 
  Just send a little mail to: omail@omnis.ch. And please, if you translate
  it to another language, please do send me the updated strings.php file!
