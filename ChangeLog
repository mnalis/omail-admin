2001-01-10  Olivier Mueller  <om@omnis.ch>

        * huge patch sent by Rey, to add basic ldap support. As it doesn't seem

	  file.

	 > I've attached a patch that does the following to omail-admin-0.96pre9:
	 > * Adds the ability to display mailboxes and/or aliases starting with a
	 >   certain letter.
	 > * Fixes strings.php to use ``&lt;'' instead of ``<'' where appropriate.
	 > * Alters the display_{mailboxes,aliases}{,_nolimit} templates to both use
	 >   the show by letter feature and to clean them up a little. :-)
