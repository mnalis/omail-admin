	- changing language doesn't work with for example: https://secure.tomsoft.hr/support2/omail-admin/index.php?&setlang=de
	- clicking on for example letter "o" for displaying mailboxes starting with "o", templating breaks -- instead of returing empty values it returns "%nb%    %username%    %PersonalInfo%   %more_alias%  %actions%:

[X] quota support   (om, 13aug2k)
[X] correct autoresponder support    (om, 03aug2k)
[X] support for non cookies enabled browsers  (om, 14aug2k)
[X] remove autoresponder info and button for aliases  (om, 03aug2k)
[X] make the enabled/disabled feature work (om, 18aug2k)
[ ] update strings for other languages
[X] for quantity of mailboxes quota, don't count system or readonly accounts!
[ ] docs about spamassassin stuff / docs in general
[ ] display mailbox size 'live', based on vmailmgrd 0.97's 'stat' command

Normal priority
---------------
[.] more translations
[X] display mailbox size : unread mails, saved mails (based on cronjob)
[X] support for info field           (om, 11aug2k)
[X] use <select> to setup expiry date on quota edition   (om, 16oct2k)
[.] add help screen / buttons
[ ] create a logo for the project
[X] support for HTML templates        (om, oct2k)
[X] better support for the + alias    (om, 15oct2k)
[X] support for specific mail accounts limitation (root, abuse, mailer-daemon, postmaster, etc.)
    -> hide, read only, or read/write   (om, 18oct2k)
[ ] case of popup screens & session timeout : close popup on session timeout
[X] display N accounts per page, better design  (om, 13nov2k)
[X] add a <select> with list of current mailboxes for forwaders addition  (om, 13nov2k)
[ ] [Matthias F. Brandstetter] turn on/off autoresponder on a cron basis 
    -> would require a cron job + some goodies
[ ] make it work with register_global = off  -> lot of (rewrite)-work necessary :(

Low priority
------------
[ ] ability to change quotas for all users at one time
[ ] webmail support  (would need vmailmgr daemon support)
[ ] display mailbox contents listing  (also need changes in daemon)
[X] add "GPL" standard headers in all source files    (om, 14aug2k)
[ ] analyse error/ok message, and give a translated version
[X] replace "Omail" by "oMail-admin" in every file
[ ] eventually secure the query strings with an md5 checksum
[ ] accounting stuff ($i++ somewhere on account creation, for a billing system for example)
[X] sort by login or real name
